Fundamentally we can think of language as a sequence of \"chunks\" of text. We can split the text into individual chunks, and then map these chunks to numerical tokens -- collectively this is the process of [tokenization](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/tokenizer_summary). Numerical tokens can then be fed into a language model.\n\nThere are several common approaches to tokenizing natural language text:\n\n1. **Word-based tokenization**: splits text into individual words. While simple, this can lead to large vocabularies and does not handle unknown words well.\n\n2. **Character-based tokenization**: splits text into individual characters. While this involves a very small vocabulary, it produces long sequences and loses word-level meaning.\n\n3. **Subword tokenization**: breaks words into smaller units (subwords) based on their frequency. The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs. Modern language models typically use subword tokenization as it balances vocabulary size and sequence length while handling unknown words effectively by breaking them into known subword units.\n\nIn this lab we will use the tokenizer from the LFM2 model, which uses BPE.

How closely does the model's style match the style of a leprechaun? As you can see from the example above, determining whether a generated response is good or not is can seem qualitative, and it can be hard to measure how well the model is doing.\n\nWhile benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the performance of language models on a variety of tasks, these benchmarks are not always representative of the real-world performance of the model. For example, a model may perform well on a benchmark but poorly on a more realistic task. Benchmarks are also limited in the scope of tasks they can cover and capabilities they can reflect, and there can be concerns about whether the data in the benchmark was used to train the model. Synthetic data generation and synthetic tasks are a way to address these limitations, and this is an active area of research.\n\nWe can also turn a qualitative evaluation of a generated response quantitative by deploying someone or something to \"judge\" the outputs. In this lab, we will use a technique called [LLM as a judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) to do exactly this. This involves using a larger LLM to score the outputs of a smaller LLM. The larger LLM is used as a judge, and it is given a system prompt that describes the task we want the smaller LLM to perform and the judging criteria. A \"system prompt\" is a way to set the general context and guide an LLM's behavior. Contextualized with this system prompt, the judge LLM can score the outputs of the smaller LLM, and we can use this score to evaluate how well the smaller LLM is doing.","metadata":{"id":"2cvhTsptBvnI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.1: Fine-tune well, you must!\n\nOur leprechaun-tuned model is already pretty good at generating responses in the leprechaun style.

The competition for this lab will be based on the following criteria:\n* **Likelihood of true Yoda-speak under your chat model**: the better your chat model does at understanding Yoda-speak, it will estimate a lower cross entropy loss for language that is true Yoda-speak. At the end of this lab, you will evaluate the likelihood of a held-out test-sample of true Yoda-speak under your chat model. Include this likelihood in your report. This gives us a quantitative measure to compare different chat models (which may have interacted with different judge LLMs).\n* **Experiments and changes you tried to improve your chat model**: include a description of changes you made and the results you observed.\n\n#### IMPORTANT: RUN THE FOLLOWING CELL BELOW TO PRINT THE RESULT BUT DO NOT MODIFY ITS CONTENTS.","metadata":{"id":"pRhbKTy2fny0"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# DO NOT CHANGE/MODIFY THIS CELL.\n# EXECUTE IT BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR ENTRY TO THE LAB.\n\nyoda_test_text = mdl.lab3.yoda_test_text\ntokens = tokenizer(yoda_test_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n\n# Get the loglikelihood from the model\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model(**tokens)\n    logits = outputs.logits[:, :-1]\n    targets = tokens.input_ids[:, 1:]\n    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.reshape(-1, logits.size(-1)),\n                            targets.reshape(-1))\n\nprint(f\"Yoda test loglikelihood: {loss.item():.2f}\")\n","metadata":{"id":"MqnrG24FBvnK"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Submission information\n\nTo enter the competition, please upload the following to the lab [submission site for the Large Language Models Lab](https://www.dropbox.com/request/l2JH7UlrayUl1Ps5ZVZm):\n\n* Jupyter notebook with the code you used to generate your results;\n* copy of the bar plot showing the judge LLM's scores of text in base style, generated text, and text in true Yoda-speak style;\n* a written description modifications you made and experimentes you tried;\n* a written discussion of why and how these modifications changed performance;\n* **the numerical result of the last cell in this notebook**.\n\nSubmissions without the result of the last cell will be automatically disqualified.\n\n**Name your file in the following format: `[FirstName]_[LastName]_LLM`, followed by the file format (.zip, .ipynb, .pdf, etc).** ZIP files are preferred over individual files.
